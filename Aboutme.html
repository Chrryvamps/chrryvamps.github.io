                    I'm Cherry Mae Saquin but you can call me 'CM' for short, a young, 
                  pretty and small but terrible woman. I'm currently living in the 3rd class of Municipality in the 
                  Province of Zamboanga del Sur at Poblacion, Mahayag Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines.
                  I am a 4th year student taking a course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 
                  at Governor Alfonso D. Tan College. Taking this course is so challeging because
                  I don't have any experience this in my previous, 
                  but I'm willing to learn everything about in this course that I take. And also that as my parents say
                  I will never give up until I don't have six degit of salary a month and a stable life. 
                  That's it. Sometimes also I am a online seller, since were not a rich family, 
                  so I need to do a part time job to earn money
                  and to buy our needs at home. Doing live and posting facebook was enjoy 
                  and selling things and clothes is fun and that was makes me less of stress.
                  I really love also keeping sentimental and valuable things. I also love watching Turkish Series.
                  I have also a dog his name is Apollo a 2 year old and cutie dogie but he was pass away last october 2021,
                  And everyday i miss my Apolloso much. I have also my parents who love me so much and I love them too much more than myself,
                  a  very supportive parents of all, my father's name is Julieto but everyone call him 'George' and he is so strong and gentleman at his age 57,
                  while my mother's name is Grace and also everyone call her 'Grasya' my 'mama' is super
                  bubbly and cheerful mother she makes everyone laugh at her jokes. And we are also 10 siblings, a very supportive and very handsome and gorgeous 
                  six sisters and three brothers.  I love them so much I can't live without them, They are all my greatest treasure</p>
